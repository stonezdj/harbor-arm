**System Requirements:**

**On a Linux host**: docker 19+  and support docker buildx

Before you build the harbor arm image, you need to check if your local environment supports docker buildx

By running the command `docker buildx ls`ï¼ŒIf the result shows `linux/arm64`, it proves that the arm image can be built

```
git clone https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-arm.git
